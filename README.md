# [WIP] Software-emulated FPU in Rust

Use 32-bit unsigned integer to represent Float32 in [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) and do float calculation.

Currently only aiming at implementing Float32.

It is in fact a by-product of one of my projects.


## TODOs

- [x] Float32 Add (partially)
- [ ] Float32 Substract
- [ ] Float32 Multiple
- [ ] Float32 Divide
- [ ] Float32 Log2
- [ ] Float32 Sqrt
- [ ] Float32 Exp
